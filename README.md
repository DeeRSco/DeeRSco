# Hi, hi!
- 👋 Hey, I’m Deanna 
- 👀 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of coding.
- 🌱 I spend my free time trying to keep my houseplants alive, playing games on my Steam deck, and seeing as much live music as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on live event production (especially within the world of gaming) or anything where you might need a hand with project management and/or operations.

## Games I'm Currently Enjoying
- Dave the Diver
- Hogwarts
- Forza Horizon 5
